The Railway Track Detection System is a safety-based technology designed to detect obstacles, cracks, or faults on railway tracks to prevent accidents. 
Using sensors, cameras, or IoT-based modules, the system continuously monitors the track condition and sends alerts to railway authorities when any abnormality is detected.
This solution helps improve railway safety, reduce delays, and prevent major accidents.

✔ Sensor-based Track Monitoring

Ultrasonic sensors or IR sensors scan the tracks for cracks or misalignments.

If any irregularity is detected, the sensor value changes.

✔ Real-Time Alert System

Microcontroller (Arduino/NodeMCU/Raspberry Pi) processes sensor data.

Sends alert messages via buzzer, GSM module, or IoT dashboard.

✔ Prevention Mechanism

Early detection helps railway authorities repair the track before an accident occurs.
